## Technologies
Javascript for frontend, HTML + CSS for site look

## Lessons Learned
This project combined challenges from a few past projects. I wanted to design a fun/good-looking/intuitive UI that could be manipulated with JavaScript, and write more JS code to change the look and function of the page on the fly. I learned some important JS tricks, especially with manipulating DOM, but I also learned lots of neat CSS to make the page look how it did (which I am very satisfied with) and I feel my HTML becoming cleaner and more standardized. I took this project a little further than intended with the color picker and eraser becuase I felt pretty confident with the JS parts and wanted to challenge myself.
